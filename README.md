Code Samples
============

In the first folder (easymac) I have uploaded samples from the new version of easymac.ro that I am working at during my spare time.

Easymac.ro was first build on an Wordpress platform, but I decided to rewrite it for learning purposes but also to have a better control of the sorce code.

It is built using Codeigniter framework and MVC design architectural pattern. I have uploaded samples containing code from User Account Management (creating new user, updating user info, changing password, login etc), a MiscModel containing useful functions for my project and a CronModel with functions for synchronizing (importing data: user and ads) from Wordpress database to the new database.

In the second folder (erp) I have uploaded samples from the ERP solution I have been working on using Symfomy 2 framework. The code consist of samples from User Management (defining new users and associating roles to them, editing, deteleting users etc) and Articles Categories Management (CRUD operations). The categories are defined on a dynamic tree architecture (the system is designed to support an infinite levels).
